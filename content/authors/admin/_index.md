My research broadly seeks to understand the role of anthropogenic factors, such as global climate change and urbanization, on the ecology and evolution of avian disease and the impacts on wild bird populations. Currently, I am a  Postdoctoral Researcher with a joint appointment at the Joint position at the University of Maryland & the USGS Eastern Ecological Science Center working with Drs. Jennifer Mullinax and Diann Prosser. Here my research expands the scope of my avian disease by addressing the current incursion of high pathogenicity avian influenza into North America. This introduction has resulted in an unprecedented and widespread epizootic event heavily impacting poultry and free-living wild birds in the spring and summer of 2022. Recent evolutionary clades of avian influenza have resulted in severe disease in previously asymptomatic wild birds along with an increased geographical spread. My research seeks to identify the changing dynamics of high pathogenicity avian influenza and use decision analysis and modeling to determine effective management options for moving forward and identifying effective and actionable avian disease management options. The collaborative aspects of this emerging disease research allow me to work with wildlife managers, decision scientists, and implement actionable science focused research.
 
I received my Ph.D. at the Texas A&M University working on avian malaria diversification in the lab of Dr. Gary Voelker. My first postdoctoral position was in Dr. Sarah Knutie’s lab looking at the affects of urbanization and an invasive parasite, Philornis downsi, on Darwin’s finches in the the Galapagos Islands. This was followed by my time as a Gerstner Scholar at the American Museum of Natural History where I began to expolore the role of climate change in range expansions and increasing impacts of avian malaria across latitudes.

I consider myself fortunate to have found science and research. As a young adult I was provided with opportunities to interact with researchers and mentors that exposed a world and opportunities that I didn’t even know existed when I was growing up. I seek to provide these opportunities and an inclusive environment in order open this world up to others and work towards improving diversity in EEB.

I spend my free time with my husband and cat, and I enjoy reading fantasy, hiking, gardening, textile crafts and swimming.
