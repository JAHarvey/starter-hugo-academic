My current research examines the novel and high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 that emerged in North America beginning in late 2021 through both a trans-Atlantic  and Northern Pacific migratory introductions. This has resulted in an unprecedented and widespread epizootic event heavily affecting poultry and free-living wild birds into the spring and summer of 2022. Continued epizootic events in the Americas are expected. The magnitude of HPAIV spread indicates the need for effective decision framing to prioritize ongoing management needs and scientific inquiry, particularly for species at risk and at interface areas for wildlife, poultry, and humans. 
In recent work we examined shifts in geographical expansion, host breadth, and temporal expansion of transmission periods. My research seeks to identifiy potential management/disease response triggers along with vulnerable species.
