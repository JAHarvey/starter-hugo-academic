My current research examines the novel and high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 that emerged in North America beginning in late 2021 through both a trans-Atlantic  and Northern Pacific migratory introductions. This has resulted in an unprecedented and widespread epizootic event heavily affecting poultry and free-living wild birds, increasinngly mammals, inlcuding dairy cattle and humans. The higher transmission and susceptibility among wild bird hosts are expected to increase the number of wildlife reservoirs for the virus, facilitating the continued spread and virus evolution. This ongoing impact threatens to change disease dynamics and expand this One Health issue. Recent work has examined shifts in geographical expansion, host breadth, and temporal expansion of transmission periods. Ongoing research tries to characterize host repsonses across wild birds and examine species vulnerability but also host roles that inform disease dynamics such as transmission and dispersal.
