My current research examines the novel and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 that emerged in North America beginning in late 2021 through both a trans-Atlantic  and Northern Pacific migratory introductions. This has resulted in an unprecedented and widespread epizootic event heavily affecting poultry and free-living wild birds in the spring and summer of 2022. A continued North epizootic is expected in the fall of 2022 as migratory waterfowl return from their breeding grounds. The magnitude of the North American HPAIV spread indicates the need for effective decision framing to prioritize ongoing management needs and scientific inquiry , particularly for species at risk and at interface areas for wildlife, poultry, and humans. I examine shifts in changing disease dynamics of this H5N1 introduction. This One Health issue may have continued detrimental effects on wild birds, poultry, and potentially human health. I am exploring decision analysis as useful tool to reframing ongoing disease science and management decisions.
